-------------------   
This is the assignment3 for my web322 project.  
Project github URL: https://github.com/fishball23333/web322-byu39.git  
My link of hosted web on cyclic: https://pink-bored-nightingale.cyclic.app/  
Note I've seperated validation processes into files in "validation" folder.  
in order to make my API router file "general.js" clean.  

NOTE: I changed the sender's email address from "...@myseneca.ca" to "@gmail.com", so that the sending process won't violate DMARC policy without seneca DNS authentication accessible. And the sender email "markyu132@gmail.com" is my personal account. The mails can be sent to normal gmail address, and usually can be found in the spam folder, based on my testing.
