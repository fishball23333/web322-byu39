-------------------   
This is the assignment 4 for my web322 project.  
Project github URL: https://github.com/fishball23333/web322-byu39.git  
My link of hosted web on cyclic: https://pink-bored-nightingale.cyclic.app/  

Note1: I've seperated validation processes into files in "validation" folder.  
in order to make my API router file "general.js" clean.  

Note2 : All the private keys are located in "/config/keys.env", and this won't be shown in my github repo, but I'll put this private file in my zip folder to the blackboard.  

Note3: Before I submitted the zip folder to the blackboard, I haven't pushed this version to gitHub since assignment3 hasn't been graded yet. So I'll wait this project will be pushed to my gitHub repo after assignment 3 is graded.
